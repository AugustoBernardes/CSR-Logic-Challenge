# CSR-Logic-Challenge
A simple chellenge to solve using javascript algorithm.
## Objective
+ Start counting from the 1st friend.
+ Count the next q friends clockwise (including what to start counting). The count can go around the circle and can count the
same friend more than once. However, only those who are still in the game and in the circle.
+ The last friend that is counted (where the count ends) leaves the game and the circle.
+ If there is more than one friend in the circle, go back to step 2 starting from the friend immediately in the clockwise sequence of the friend who just
exit and repeat the process.
+ If there is only one friend in the circle, he wins the game.
